## Inspiration
We collectively enjoy data science, and this hackathon seemed like the perfect opportunity to test ourselves with understanding, manipulating, and displaying data in a readable way.

## What it does
Our project takes a database of current orders and their status and displays them respectively. It also keeps track of each subpart of the inventory, showing the fullness of them and optionally displaying their components.

## How we built it
We used Python for our project, PyQt6 library for our GUI, and sqlite3 for our database. With such, we were able to create, manage, and display important information to the reader.

## Challenges we ran into
We had some trouble with coming up with a design that we were all happy with using. After hours of iterations in our design, we had finally started writing some lines of code with our idea in mind.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of how this turned out. Our database is written very compactly with an easy-to-understand indexing from itemID-weight. We are proud to display our GUI as we think it has visually turned out very well, not to mention its functionality working behind it.

## What we learned
We learned and became confortable with new libraries, but most importantly, we learned that we are able to apply what we know already in conjunction with our drive and ability to learn in order to create a project that was initially outside of our comfort zone. Overall, our project was a major success.

## What's next for Commercial Lynks Inc: Inventory Management System
There can never be enough changes. Because we focused on code maintainability, we will be able to add new features to our program without interfering with preexisting ones.
